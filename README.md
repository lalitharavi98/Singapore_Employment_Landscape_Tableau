# Singapore Employment landscape: CS5346 Information Visualisation Project

Understanding Singapore's employment market dynamics is crucial for assessing economic
health and individual career prospects. However, the complexity of Singapore's employment data
poses challenges for stakeholders like job seekers, employers, and policymakers. Traditional static
data formats hinder in-depth analysis and trend identification. This project addresses this
limitation by developing an interactive data visualisation tool leveraging Ministry of Manpower
(MOM) data to provide insightful exploration of Singapore's employment landscape. Employment
levels are essential indicators of job creation capacity and labour market health, reflecting
economic shifts. Analysis of employment distribution across industries reveals trends like industry
growth or decline, aiding policymakers, businesses, and researchers in informed decision-making.
Data on employment, unemployment, labour turnover, and retrenchment from MOM's repository
form the foundation for this study.
